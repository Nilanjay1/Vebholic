Objective: Identify the company that owns each energy generation project in the assigned list.

Research Methods: Use project details (fuel type, capacity, location, transmission owner, etc.) to validate search results and corroborate ownership information.

Supporting Documents: Search for interconnection studies, applications, permits, and regulatory filings that may disclose ownership, using data points like queue ID and point of interconnection.

External Sources: Explore project lists, announcements, and presentations from transmission owners for additional ownership details.

Output: Record the project owner(s) and source information in the project spreadsheet for each researched entry.
